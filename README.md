# copilot-startUp-specs

A small repository of specification files and configuration used by the HackMind-GenAI "copilot-startUp-specs" project. This README documents the repository layout, purpose of each file, development setup, common commands, and contribution guidance.

**Repository purpose**: store and version YAML specification files and small utilities that describe authentication, summarization, and other AI workflow configurations used during the Google Hackathon.

**Maintainers**: HackMind-GenAI

---

**Project Structure**

- `README.md` - This document.
- `core/` - Core specification files and primary configs.
	- `auth.yaml` - Authentication-related configuration (secrets, providers, or sample auth flows).
- `utility/` - Utility specs and supporting configurations.
	- `summarize.yaml` - Summarization workflow spec used by a utility or service.

Notes: the repository is intentionally small and mostly contains YAML spec files used by other tooling in your organization. Treat these files as canonical configuration and keep them minimal and reviewable in PRs.

---

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites:
- macOS / Linux / Windows with a POSIX-like shell.
- `git` installed and configured.
- (Optional) `python` 3.8+ or `node` if you plan to run tools that consume these YAML specs. This repo does not include a runtime by default.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HackMind-GenAI/copilot-startUp-specs.git
cd copilot-startUp-specs
git checkout feature/chat
```

View files:

```bash
ls -la
tree -a  # if you have tree installed
cat core/auth.yaml
cat utility/summarize.yaml
```

**Working with the YAML specs**

Guidance for editing and validating YAML files in this repo:

- Always edit on a feature branch and open a Pull Request.
- Keep changes focused to a single spec per PR when possible.
- Validate YAML syntax locally:

```bash
# Install a YAML linter if you don't have one (example using npm):
npm install -g yaml-cli

# Check syntax
yamllint core/auth.yaml
yamllint utility/summarize.yaml

# Or a quick python check
python -c "import yaml,sys; yaml.safe_load(sys.stdin.read())" < utility/summarize.yaml
```

Replace `yamllint` or the python snippet with your preferred linter.

---

**Common Tasks & Commands**

- Create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/update-summarize-spec
```

- Stage and commit changes:

```bash
git add utility/summarize.yaml
git commit -m "Improve summarize spec: add examples and metadata"
git push --set-upstream origin feat/update-summarize-spec
```

- Open a Pull Request on GitHub using the web UI or CLI:

```bash
gh pr create --fill
```

---

**Testing & Validation**

This repository contains only spec files; there are no unit tests included. If you integrate these specs with a service, run that service's validation or unit tests. Example quick checks:

- YAML parsing check (Python):

```bash
python -c "import yaml,sys; yaml.safe_load(open('utility/summarize.yaml'))" && echo 'summarize.yaml OK'
```

- JSON conversion (for downstream tools that accept JSON):

```bash
python -c "import yaml,json; print(json.dumps(yaml.safe_load(open('utility/summarize.yaml')), indent=2))" > utility/summarize.json
```

**Branching & Release Model**

- This repo uses feature branches (e.g., `feature/*`) for work in progress.
- Merge into `main` via pull request after review.

---

**Contributing**

Please follow these steps for contributions:

1. Fork the repository (if you do not have direct push access).
2. Create a descriptive branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`.
3. Add or change only necessary files and update this README if the change affects usage.
4. Run the YAML validation steps above.
5. Commit logically grouped changes with clear messages.
6. Open a Pull Request and add reviewers.

Include in PR description:
- Summary of change
- Reasoning / context
- Any backward-compatibility concerns

---

**Security**

- Do not commit secrets or private keys. If a spec requires sensitive values, reference environment variables or secret managers in comments.
- If you discover a security issue, notify the maintainers and open a security advisory instead of a public PR.

---

**Notes & Next Steps**

- If you'd like, I can:
	- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and a simple `LICENSE` file.
	- Add GitHub Action workflow to validate YAML on PRs.
	- Generate example consumer scripts for these specs.

If you want any of the above, tell me which and I will add them.
